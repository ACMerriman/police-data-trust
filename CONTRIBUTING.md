## [Issues and Feature Requests](https://github.com/codeforboston/police-data-trust/issues)

- If you have a feature request or but report, our [issues page](https://github.com/codeforboston/police-data-trust/issues) is where to go to place those.
- If you think that you've found a bug in the application, first be certain that you're testing against the most recent version of the application available on the main repo. If not, search our [issues list](https://github.com/codeforboston/police-data-trust/issues) on GitHub in case a similar issue has already been opened.

## If You're New to Open Source

If you're brand new to Git and/or GitHub, you'll want to familiarize yourself with the basics of version control, which you can do with Github's [Hello World tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) 

## [Making Pull Requests]()

Pull requests are merged into our main branch. This makes main our main development branch. You'll want to keep your fork and local repo current with this branch so you're always working off the latest code. To do so, run these commands:

git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
