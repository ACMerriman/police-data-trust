The Police Misconduct Data Collaborative project has a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codeforboston/codeforboston.org/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
to which all contributors must adhere.

## [Issues and Feature Requests](https://github.com/codeforboston/police-data-trust/issues)

- If you have a feature request or but report, our [issues page](https://github.com/codeforboston/police-data-trust/issues) is where to go to place those.
- If you think that you've found a bug in the application, first be certain that you're testing against the most recent version of the application available on the main repo. If not, search our [issues list](https://github.com/codeforboston/police-data-trust/issues) on GitHub in case a similar issue has already been opened.

## Python Code Contributions

#### Style guide:

- Use [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) above everything. We adhere to 80 line limits and 4 space indents.
- Also use the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

#### Before you submit a [pull request](https://github.com/codeforboston/police-data-trust/pulls):

- Run backend tests with `python -m pytest`
- Run flake8 with `flake8 backend/`. If flake8 gives you any trouble, you can run `black backend/` to prettify your code automatically or use `# noqa` comments _sparingly_ if you are absolutely sure a line of code is fine.
